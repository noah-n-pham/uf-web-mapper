---

## **🎨 Part 1: Warm Academic Color Theme**

### **What You'll See:**

#### **Light Mode (Warm & Inviting):**
```
Background: Warm cream (#fefcf9) - like aged quality paper

```
Background: Rich charcoal (#0f0e0d) - not pure black!
Cards: Coffee brown (#252320) - warm depth
Text: Warm white (#faf8f6) - not harsh blue-white!

## **🗺️ Part 2: Hexagonal Multi-Cluster Layout**

### **The New Algorithm:**

#### **Hexagonal Grid Distribution:**
```
Pattern: Honeycomb / offset grid

Row 1: [S1]  [S2]  [S3]  [S4]  [S5]  [S6]  [S7]  [S8]  [S9]
Row 2:    [S10] [S11] [S12] [S13] [S14] [S15] [S16] [S17]
Row 3: [S18] [S19] [S20] [S21] [S22] [S23] [S24] [S25] [S26]
...

Each subsite = independent island
Odd rows shifted right by 325px (half hex width)
Generous spacing: 650px horizontal, 550px vertical
```

#### **Local Page Orbits (When Expanded):**
```
        Page3  Page4  Page5
           ╲    |    ╱
     Page2─────[SUBSITE]─────Page6
           ╱    |    ╲
        Page1  Page8  Page7

Each subsite has its OWN constellation
Pages orbit 220px radius in circular pattern
Up to 32 pages (4 concentric rings of 8)
No overlap with neighboring clusters
```

### **Why This Works:**

✅ **Hexagonal Grid = Perfect Tiling**
- Mathematical optimal packing
- Equal distance between all neighbors
- Natural, organic appearance
- No wasted space

✅ **Generous Spacing (650px × 550px)**
- Each "island" has 650px width, 550px height
- Enough room for expanded clusters
- Pages orbit 220px, leaves 430px buffer
- No overlap even when multiple expanded

✅ **Stable Layout**
- Subsites stay in fixed grid positions
- Only pages appear/disappear
- No chaotic repositioning
- Predictable, calm UX

✅ **Visual Clarity**
- Each cluster clearly separated
- 8 distinct color gradients cycle
- Easy to identify which pages belong where
- Looks like a map of constellations

## **🎯 Layout Specifications:**

### **Hexagonal Grid Parameters:**
```javascript
Columns: 9 subsites per row
Horizontal Spacing: 650px
Vertical Spacing: 550px
Odd Row Offset: 325px (creates hexagonal pattern)

Formula:
x = 150 + (col × 650) + (row % 2 × 325)
y = 150 + (row × 550)
```

### **Page Orbit Parameters:**
```javascript
Base Orbit Radius: 220px
Pages Per Layer: 8
Additional Layers: +80px radius each
Max Pages Shown: 32 (4 layers)

Formula:
angle = (pageIndex % 8) × (360° / 8) - 90°
layer = floor(pageIndex / 8)
radius = 220 + (layer × 80)
x = subsiteX + radius × cos(angle)
y = subsiteY + radius × sin(angle)
```

## **🌈 Color System Details:**

### **8 Vibrant Cluster Colors:**

Each subsite gets a unique gradient (cycles through):

1. **Blue** - Technology, Admin
2. **Emerald** - Education, Programs  
3. **Purple** - Research, Academic
4. **Pink** - Student Services
5. **Orange** - Alumni, News
6. **Teal** - Faculty, Resources
7. **Indigo** - Special Programs
8. **Cyan** - Support, Helpdesk

**Pages inherit parent's color family:**
- Blue subsite → Light blue pages
- Emerald subsite → Light emerald pages
- Etc.

### **Search Highlights:**
- **Amber/Gold gradient** for matches
- Ring glow effect
- Animated edges
- Stands out from all cluster colors

---

## **🎮 Interactions:**

### **Expand a Cluster:**
```
1. Click any subsite node
2. Pages animate in (spring physics)
3. Appear in circular orbit around parent
4. Chevron changes ▶ → ▼
5. Node scales up 110%
6. Other clusters stay in place (stable!)
```

### **Search & Zoom:**
```
1. Type "educational"
2. Matching nodes turn amber/gold
3. Auto-zoom to first match (1000ms smooth)
4. Navigate with arrows
5. Each match highlighted in its own cluster
```

### **Move & Undo:**
```
1. Drag a subsite to new position
2. "Moves: 1" appears in stats
3. Press Ctrl/⌘ + Z
4. Node returns to hexagonal position
5. Stable layout maintained
```

## **📊 Visual Layout:**

### **55 Subsites in Hexagonal Grid:**
```
      Generous Spacing (650px × 550px)
      
[S1]      [S2]      [S3]      [S4]      [S5]
   [S6]      [S7]      [S8]      [S9]      [S10]
[S11]     [S12]     [S13]     [S14]     [S15]
   [S16]     [S17]     [S18]     [S19]     [S20]
   
... (7 rows total for 55 subsites)

Each box = 650×550px "island"
No overlap, clear separation
Looks like a map of islands
```

### **Expanded Cluster (Local Orbit):**
```
            Page
         ●       ●
    ●               ●
         [SUBSITE]        (220px orbit)
    ●               ●
         ●       ●
            Page

Pages orbit in perfect circle
Up to 32 pages (4 concentric rings)
All contained within 650px width
No interference with neighbors
```

Result: Pages fully contained, no overlap!
```

### **For 55 Subsites:**
