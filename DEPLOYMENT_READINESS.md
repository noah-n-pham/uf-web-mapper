## üìù Next Steps for Deployment

### Immediate (Before First Deploy)
1. ‚úÖ **All completed** - Project is ready!

### For Vercel Deployment
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import repository to Vercel
3. Verify auto-detected settings
4. Deploy (no env vars needed)
5. Test production URL

**Time estimate**: 5-10 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Guide**: See DEPLOYMENT.md, "Vercel Deployment" section

### For GitHub Actions Setup
1. Add repository secret: `CRAWLER_CONTACT_EMAIL`
2. Enable workflow write permissions
3. Rename `crawler.yml.template` to `crawler.yml`
4. Test manual workflow trigger
5. (Optional) Uncomment schedule for weekly runs

**Time estimate**: 10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Guide**: See .github/workflows/SETUP.md
