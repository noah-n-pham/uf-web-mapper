# DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ========================================

# For production/public repos:
# 1. Never commit your .env file (already in .gitignore)
# 2. Always set CRAWLER_CONTACT_EMAIL to a valid email you monitor
# 3. Use higher DELAY_MS values (500-1000) for public crawling
# 4. Respect robots.txt (crawler does this automatically)
# 5. Monitor server responses and adjust rate limits if needed

# For GitHub Actions:
# Set these as repository secrets:
# - CRAWLER_CONTACT_EMAIL (required)
# Other variables can use defaults or be set as needed
