## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready!

Everything is configured and tested. Choose your deployment path:

1. **Just deploy the frontend**: Follow Vercel steps above
2. **Set up automated crawls**: Follow GitHub Actions steps above
3. **Do both**: Deploy to Vercel first, then set up Actions

**Estimated total time**: 15-20 minutes for both
