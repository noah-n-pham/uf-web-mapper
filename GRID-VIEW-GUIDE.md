  - By Confidence (high → medium → low)
- **Filter by confidence:**
  - All subsites
  - High confidence only
  - Medium confidence only

### 3. **Detail Panel**
- Slides in from right when clicking a card
- Shows comprehensive subsite information:
  - Full title and URL (clickable)
  - Status (Live/Offline)
  - Detection confidence badge
  - Detection method explanation
  - Total page count
  - **Complete list of all pages** with:
    - Page title
    - Path
    - Live status
    - Link to visit page
    - Outbound links (collapsible)

### 4. **Header & Stats**

## 🎨 Design Features

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Green badges** = High confidence
