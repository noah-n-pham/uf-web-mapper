# UF COE Web Mapper - Project Rules

## Project Context
This is the UF College of Education Web Ecosystem Mapper MVP. It consists of:
1. A TypeScript crawler in `/crawler` that discovers WordPress subsites
2. A Next.js frontend with React Flow visualization at `/app/map`

## Important Constraints
- DO NOT overwrite root config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.ts, tailwind.config.*, postcss.config.mjs
- DO NOT commit or push to Git automatically
- The crawler has its own package.json and tsconfig.json in `/crawler`
- Frontend components are in `/app/components` and `/app/map`

## Architecture Notes
- Crawler outputs to `public/data.json`
- Frontend reads `public/data.json` for visualization
- WordPress detection uses: wp-json → wp-content → meta (3-tier fallback)
- Rate limiting: 250ms delay, 5 concurrent requests
- User-Agent: Configured via CRAWLER_CONTACT_EMAIL environment variable
- See `env.example` for required crawler configuration

## When Making Changes
- For crawler: Edit files in `/crawler/src`
- For frontend: Edit files in `/app/components` or `/app/map`
- Always maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Keep MVP scope: no Lighthouse, no auth, no heavy features
- Document any new dependencies in DEPENDENCIES.md
